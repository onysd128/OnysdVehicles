### IDEAS LIST
1. 🔑 Finish key system for every existing vehicle in mod 🔐 ✅
2. 💥 Finish collision system for vehicles, so vehicles would push and damage mobs, player, and other vehicles 🚙 ✅
3. ⚡ Do something with vehicles wich has electric engines.It's not ok that they have to take fuel to ride. ⛽ <br>
    3.1 Maybe create a charging station, and make vehicles with electric engines to take 'fuel' from them.<br>
    3.2 Maybe create a car battery and slot fot it in vehicle upgrade UI. This may be easier but i like this less then previous punct.<br>
    3.3 It's may be cool to give player ability to choose engine type. So, like, it's will be 4 engine types: Small, Big, Electric Small, Electic Big. And depends on engine type it will change needed 'fuel' type: fuellium or electricity. Sound will also changing. So, that way vehicle will have two option for engine type parameter: Big or Small.
4. ⚙️ Change config, so every vehicle can be configured separately with this values:<br>
    4.1 Fuel needed.<br>
    4.2 Can be locked.<br>
    4.3 Can be lifted.<br>
    4.4 Can be lifted only by owner.<br>
    4.5 Can take damage.<br>
    4.6 Can be crafted.<br>
    4.7 Can be used/changed only by owner. <br>
    4.8 Can be destroyed.<br>
    4.9 Etc.<br>
5. 🛠️ Add working helicopter 🚁
6. 🛠️ Add working bicycle 🚲
7. Add chest slot for storage trailer and moped, so chest can be removed or replaced, meybe with chests from other mods.
8. Add integrations for other chests mods, like Iron Chests, so chests from this mod can be placed on moped, to have bigger storage, or can be used in storage trailer craft.
9. Fix the sound issue, when if vehicles is not installed, it's play wrench sound even on placing/removing engine to/from slot.
